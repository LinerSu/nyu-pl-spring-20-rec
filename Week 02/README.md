# Binding, Scoping and Control Flow

## (Name) Binding

- Def. An association of entities with identifiers (name)
	- Entities: classes, functions, data, types, etc.
```c++
int i = 1; // Name value
void my_func () {} // Name function
typedef int myint; // Name type
```
- Binding time: the time ([program lifecycle phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_lifecycle_phase)) to make this association

### Early Binding (Static)
- Def. name binding performed before the program is running (at compile time).
- What are the benefits of static binding?
	- Efficiency: the association are made during the compilation time, which means the compiler could make some optimizations for the code generation
	- Invariance: the compilation phase fixes all types of variables and expressions.

### Late Binding (Dynamic)
- Def. name binding achieved during the program execution (during run time). 
- What are some advantages of this one?
	- Flexibility: languages give more control to programmer (e.g. postpone binding)
	- Polymorphic code: code that can be used on objects of different types isÂ polymorphic.
		- Subtype polymorphism (**dynamic dispatch**)
		- Parametric polymorphism (**generics**)
- Consider the following Python3 code:
```Python
func_lsts = []
for i in range(3):
    def adder(x):
        return i + x
    func_lsts.append(adder)

print('{}'.format(str([adr(2) for adr in func_lsts])))
```
**Q:** What does this program output?

## Scoping
- Def. A scope is the region of program text where a binding is active.
- Global scope: binding is visible throughout the entire programs.
	- Global variable: a variable with global scope. The lifetime of this kind variable is the duration from the program started to terminated.
- Function scope: the scope of variable is within the function
	- Local variable: a variable with function scope. The lifetime is the duration of the function call.
- Variable shadowing: in a certain scope, if you redeclare a variable, the original binding is hidden, and has a hole in its scope.
- Consider the following C++ example:
```c++
using namespace std; // imports all bindings made in std namespace
int x = 0; // Assume it is a global variable

void f () {
	int x = 4; // x now binds to value 4
	cout<<"The x inside f is: "<<x<<endl;
}

f();
cout<<"The x outside f is: "<<x<<endl;
```

### Static / Lexical Scoping
- Def. binding of a name is determined by rules that refer only to the program text.
- Thus, the scope of a variable depends on the code (syntactic) structure.

**Q:** How do we know a variable's scoping by using static scoping approach?

```c++
float x = 0.0;
int y = 0;

void f () {
    int x = 0;
    x = x + 1;
    {
        int x = 2;
        y = y + x;
    }
    y = y - x;
}
```
- Typically, compiled programming languages (e.g. C++, Java) use (parse) tree structure to detect scoping error during the compile time, and interpreted languages (e.g. Python) use stack (via static link) to check variable's scoping in the run time.

### Dynamic Scoping
- Def. binding of a name is given by the most recent declaration encountered during the run-time.
- That means: the variable's scope is depending on the execution order.

**Q:** How to determine scoping of each variable under dynamic scoping?

```lisp
(defun f ()
    (print x)
)

(defun g()
    (defvar x 2)
    (f)
)

(g)
```

- There are two ways to implement dynamic scoping:
	- Deep access (via dynamic link): during the run time, the compiler traverses the dynamic chain of stacks to look up the variables.
	- Shallow access: use one stack for each variable name.
- But using dynamic scoping is not a better idea than using static for developing.

### Scoping examples
To help you understand the difference, consider this C++ code:
```c++
int x = 2; // This is not a global variabe

void f(){
    int x = 3;
}

int g(){
    f();
    return x + 4;
}

int h(){
    int x = 5;
    return g();
}

printf("function g returns %d", g());
printf("function h returns %d", h());
```
1. Assume program will run under static scoping, what does this program print?
	<details><summary>Solution</summary>
	<p>

	```
	function g returns 6
	function h returns 6
	```
     </p></details>

2. Assume program will run under dynamic scoping, what does this program print?
	<details><summary>Solution</summary>
	<p>

        ```
	function g returns 6
	function h returns 9
	```
     </p></details>
     
## Control Flow
- Def. the order of execution for individual statements, expressions, or function calls.

### Sequencing
- Def. execute statements or evaluate expression in sequential order.
- Statement vs. expression:
	- Expression is a combination of one or more explicit identifiers, literals and operators.
		```c++
		1 + 2 // Arithmetic expression
		func_call(3) // Callsite expression
		```
	- Statement is the smallest element that expresses some action to be carried out.
		```c++
		int x; // Declaration Statement
		x = 1; // Assignment Statement
		if (true) {x;} else {0;} // If statement
		for (int i = 0;i<10;i++){x++;} // For loop statement
		return x; // Return statement
		{ x = 3; x = x + 1;} // Block Statement
		```
	- We could say an expression is part of a statement.
- Order of value computation vs. Order of evaluation
	- We have learned the precedence and associativity last week, those guide the compiler to do each computation.
	- Do not confuse order of value computation with order of evaluation.

### Selection
- Def. execute one of two statements according to the value of a Boolean expression.
- Short circuit evaluation: given a Boolean expression, the second argument will not be evaluated if the first condition meets.
- Consider the following C++ code:
```c++
void f () {
    bool x = true;
    bool y = false;
    if (x || (x && y)) {
        cout<<"Pass here!"<<endl;
        return;
    }
}

f();
```

### Iteration
- Def. execute a piece of statements repeatedly.
	```c++
	while (condition) statement
	```
	- `condition` is evaluated at each iteration
	- if it evaluates to `true`, we execute `statement`
	- otherwise, if `false`, we exit the loop.
- Breaking: `break` allows you to jump out of the loop early.
